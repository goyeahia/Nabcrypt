# Nabcrypt
Nabcrypt is a simple user friendly tool to encrypt data with strong algorithm. This tool is very flexible cause it lets user to choose manually hash and cryptographic algorithm. Though it is upon on user but it is recommended to choose AES - 256 and SHA3 - 512. I don't think i need to explicate the usage of this tool cause it is very easy to use. Just open the file, choose a strong password, hash and cryptographic algorithm. Then press encrypt ! 

Warning :
`If you forget the password of encryption then all of your data are gone. This tool usage password based key derivation technique to generate key for encryption.
So remember your password. Yeah i know it's difficult. That's why i am building another tool for managing passwords ! "
